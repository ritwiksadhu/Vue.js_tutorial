<!--     
        1. interpolation expression are given by 'v-something'
        2. like the span has an id with a variable
        3. in this case we are binding id with v-bind, but we can bind attribute

        

        NOTE: we can remember it like we are binding the vue variables with our html same as we used to do in js binding
     -->
